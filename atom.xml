    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <strong>Pomodoro</strong> time management technique, created by
Francesco
Cirillo in the 80&rsquo;s. In this post I&rsquo;ll describe what it is, how I use it
(tools and their tweaks), and how it helps me to get through my day.</p>

<h2>Interruptions</h2>

<p>Interruptions are horrible. They are your productivity&rsquo;s worst enemy.
Jason Fried gave excellent <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work.html">talk</a> on that. In fact, the most important
measurement of quality of your working environment (and working style) is how
much uninterrupted time you can have per day.</p>

<p>There are external interruptions. A dozen of devices ring one after another.
Notifications pop up on the screen. People come talk to us.  It&rsquo;s hard to get
away even for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s also interruptions of our own. We become &ldquo;tired&rdquo; and &ldquo;feel like
we deserve a break&rdquo;. We open up twitter and who knows if we come back
for next 30 minutes. Or some idea just hits us in the middle of the working
day, and we can&rsquo;t help but think it over and over again, while, at the same
time, trying to stay focused on current task.</p>

<p>The thing is, we can&rsquo;t just shut off all notifications and don&rsquo;t talk to
anybody. At least not for a long time. We are team workers, and have to
interact. And we can&rsquo;t work without breaks all day long, but we want to
control them, so a little trip to Facebook don&rsquo;t become a time-wasting
disaster. We don&rsquo;t want our brilliant ideas to get lost, but we want to work
on them on priority.</p>

<h2>Pomodoro is here to help</h2>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a Pomodoro Technique (<a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/download/pdf/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">pdf</a>). In short, it offers you to work
for a fixed amount of time, and then have a fixed short break.</p>

<p>You set a timer to 25 minutes(canonical), and, during that time, you shut off
all your notifications. Nothing and no one can interrupt you, even your
lazy-self. You&rsquo;re don&rsquo;t let yourself to think of any extraneous thoughts. If
something pops up to your mind, you write it down somewhere (if it&rsquo;s worth it)
to come back to it later.</p>

<p>After timer rings, you immediately stop what you&rsquo;re doing, checking your email
and other messages, you go get that co-worker who had a question. And, more
importantly, you&rsquo;re having a scheduled break for 5 minutes or so. It&rsquo;s a good
time to stand up, walk outside, get some water and fresh air, <a href="http://infographicsmania.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Bathroom-Break-Yoga-infographic.jpg">limber up</a>,
give your brain, eyes and whole body some rest.</p>

<p>This is just the right balance between work and rest. It gives ability
to be interrupted and communicate only when you&rsquo;re available and when you don&rsquo;t mind.
It also makes you more self-disciplined in general, as well as it&rsquo;s a good will-power
exercise.</p>

<h2>But how &lsquo;bout my Flow?</h2>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a>. The thing with Flow is hard to get in and so easy to get
out. Some of Pomodoro newbies complain that this forced break is a
Flow-killer. But I don&rsquo;t think it is. Well, Pomodoro helps you to get into the
Flow at the first place. And, again, you don&rsquo;t want to get lost for several
hours for the team, draining all of your brain &amp; body power, leaving yourself
completely exhausted. Pomodoro helps to stay productive all day
(days/weeks/months), not just a few Flow hours.</p>

<p>Yes, it is hard to go for a break when you&rsquo;re in a middle of something. But it
teaches you to respect your time and &ldquo;protect Pomodoro at all cost&rdquo;, so you
can do more. Also, when it&rsquo;s couple of minutes left on the timer, you should
start writing down what you&rsquo;re doing now, and what you&rsquo;re going to do next
(which is a good thing to do anyway). So, for me, that&rsquo;s never been a problem
to get back to the same point after a break.</p>

<p>But every workflow is different, and every mind is different. For example in
ability to stay focused on a task for a long period of time. So, I can suggest
to just try it out for a few days and see if it works for you.</p>

<h2>Start it slow</h2>

<p>A quick tip for Pomodoro beginners &ndash; start it slow. Maybe you would want
to start with 10 minutes of high quality Pomodoro. Or even 5 minutes. And
increase length over time. Because successful short Pomodoros are better than
few <a href="https://twitter.com/kubem/status/350390764515233792">#procastodoros</a>.</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s an app for that</h2>

<p>In fact, that can be enough to use a kitchen timer (the one they&rsquo;re
<a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/timer/">offering</a> on the site) with just pen &amp; paper. I know a bunch of developers
who use pen &amp; notebooks as a primary GTD tool and it works for them. And if it
works for you &ndash; that&rsquo;s fine. But there sure some apps. I&rsquo;ll describe my
favorites. Each one works best in certain circumstances.</p>

<h4><a href="http://tomato.es/">Tomato.es (Web)</a></h4>

<p>The best way to try Pomodoro out. You don&rsquo;t have to install anything. Just
open new tab with this application, sign in with Github or Twitter
(optionally), hit Space bar and see the timer going. It&rsquo;ll ring when Pomodoro
is over and send Chrome&rsquo;s desktop notification. And there&rsquo;s a nice daily,
weekly, monthly stats and even Leaderboards.  After all, it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/potomak/tomatoes">opensource</a>, so you can suggest (or
better develop) some new features.</p>

<h4><a href="http://teamodoro.com/">Teamodoro.com (Web)</a></h4>

<p>This one is for team synchronization. You can&rsquo;t stop and start Pomodoros,
they&rsquo;re just starting automatically and counter is the same for everybody. And
nice and simple fullscreen view to put on external monitor/device.</p>

<h4><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wind-up-timer/id325610693?mt=8">Wind-up Timer (iOS)</a></h4>

<p>Swipe to set a timer to desired time. It ticks in the background. It rings in
the end. Nice design. It is always in your pocket or desk. Well, mostly. I was
happy with it at first. But there&rsquo;s no way to disable iOS notifications and
keep the screen unlocked. So you basically set a timer and enable airplane
mode or lock the screen. Still useful sometimes.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/ugol/pomodoro">Pomodoro.app (OSX)</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/2w34273X191m1W1r1B2i/Screenshot_6_30_13_9_15_PM-2.png">[screenshot]</a></p>

<p>The most advanced OSX Pomodoro I&rsquo;ve seen. You can configure everything.
Pomodoro length, break length, automatic restarts, sounds, Growl
notifications, Twitter integration, Calendar intergration and, finally,
execute applescripts on Pomodoro start/end/reset/interrupt/resume. And this
opens endless possibilities, like disabling all possible notifications on your
Mac &amp; Devices when Pomodoro starts, and automatically re-enable them when
Pomodoro ends. And, for instance, send message to Campfire. Check out my
set of <a href="https://github.com/vrybas/pomodoro-scripts">pomodoro-scripts</a>.</p>

<p>The app is <a href="https://github.com/ugol/pomodoro">opensource</a>, you can compile it with XCode. Or download
precompiled version <a href="http://cl.ly/3Q3H333y2132">here</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaktime/id427475982?mt=12">BreakTime (OSX)</a></h4>

<p>This is not exactly a Pomodoro. It&rsquo;s just locks your screen after specified
amount of time, so you are forced to take a break. Sometimes I use it
standalone, or accompanied with other tools. Can execute applescripts.</p>

<h4><a href="http://thymerb.com/">Thyme (console)</a></h4>

<p>And, finally, the terminal solution. Which have nice progressbar, Tmux
integration, and can also execute applescripts (via <a href="https://github.com/vrybas/dotfiles/blob/4b0f29c0dd688f8bb78eec5d66f6c657a4bf9bb1/thyme/thymerc.symlink#L4">osascript</a>) or any
other terminal commands.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Be productive, respect your time, and happy Pomodoring!</p>
